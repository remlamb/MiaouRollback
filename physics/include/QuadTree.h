     * The QuadTree class represents a quadtree, a tree data structure used for spatial partitioning in applications
     * such as collision detection. The quadtree divides space into quadrants, allowing for efficient spatial queries.
     *
     * The class has the following members:
     * - `HeapAllocator heapAllocator`: An allocator for managing memory used by the quadtree.
     * - `AllocatedVector<QuadNode> nodes{StandardAllocator<QuadNode>{heapAllocator}}` : represent the nodes created in the quad tree
     * - `int nodeIndex`: index used to navigate through the nodes.
     * - `AllocatedVector <ColliderPair> nodeColliderPairs{StandardAllocator <ColliderPair > {heapAllocator}}`: An allocated vector to store collider pairs within the quadtree.
     * - `static const auto MaxColliderInNode`: A constant defining the maximum number of colliders allowed in a single quadtree node.
     * - `static const auto MaxDepth`: A constant defining the maximum depth of the quadtree.
     *
     * The class provides the following methods:
     * - `void Init()`: pre allocating memory for nodes and collider pairs.
     * - `void Subdivide(QuadNode& node)`: Subdivides the quad node into four children, splitting the space into quadrants.
     * - `void InsertInRootNode(const SimplifiedCollider &simplifiedCollider) noexcept`: Inserts a simplified collider into the root QuadNode of the QuadTree.
     * - `void SubdivideNodeRecursively(QuadNode &node, int depth) noexcept`: Recursively subdivides a QuadNode if it contains more colliders than the maximum allowed or if the depth limit is not reached.
     * - `void FindPossiblePairs(QuadNode &node) noexcept`: Finds possible collider pairs within a QuadNode and its children.
     * - `void FindInChildrenNodePossiblePairs(QuadNode &node, Engine::ColliderRef &colliderRef) noexcept`: Finds possible collider pairs between a specific collider and the colliders within a QuadNode and its children.
     * - `void Clear() noexcept`: Clears the QuadTree, resetting it to an empty state.
     *
     * This class facilitates the creation and management of a quadtree for spatial partitioning of colliders.
